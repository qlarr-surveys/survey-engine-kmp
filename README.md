# Qlarr Survey Engine
Qlarr Survey Engine is a UI-agnostic tool that lets you create and run customizable, scientific & offline-first **surveys as code** on all platforms. Surveys are defined using JSON to represent structure and [Javascript](https://github.com/qlarr-surveys/survey-engine-script) instructions to represent survey logic. Qlarr Survey Engine parses the survey definition and into a **JavaScript State Machine** that reacts to user interaction to manage and update the survey state.

## Usecases
Qlarr Survey Engine has two main usecases


### Process Survey (during survey design)
Qlarr Survey Engine takes the survey design as input and generates the following:
1. **Component Graph**: Survey components organized into nodes linked by parent-child and sibling relationships, ensuring scope validation and logical consistency.
2. **State Machine Files**: Resources to build a state machine that runs on UI to react to user interaction and update the survey state.
3. **DB Schema**: The schema to generate a relational database to save the survey responses
4. **Augmented/Validated Design**: The survey design file with structure and logic validated and with additional instructions that supports navigation

### Navigate Survey (during survey execution)
takes processed survey and existing user responses (if any) and generates:
1. **Reduced Survey**: Survey structure reduced to include the relevant content according to the user current location in the survey
2. **Survey State**: Resources to build a state machine that runs on UI to react to user interaction and update the survey state.
3. **Values to Save**: the user responses to save to the database

## State of Development
This library is writted in Kotlin JVM, and used to support a Spring boot backend and an Android application. 
Future plan is to re-write it in Kotlin Native, to support also Node.js backend and iOS applications.
